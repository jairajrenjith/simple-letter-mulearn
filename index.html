    <p class="title">REQUEST FOR WAIVER OF FIRST PRIZE CASH</p>

    <p>Respected Sir,</p>

    <p>I, <span class="italic">Jairaj Renjith</span>, hereby request your kind approval to release the first prize
       amount for the event we secured at Adhvaya. However, since I was unable to stay back
       and collect the cash prize directly on the day of the event due to unavoidable circumstances,
       I kindly seek your permission to receive the amount at a later date.</p>

    <p>I assure you that all required details and verification can be provided upon request. I would be
       grateful if you could consider my situation and approve the release of the prize amount.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Thanking you.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Yours faithfully,<br>
    Jairaj R<br>
    Team Leader</p>
