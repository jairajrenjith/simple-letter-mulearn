    <p>Date: 26 November 2025</p><br>

    <p class="title">RE: Ph.D. Application, Response and Next Procedural Guidelines</p>

    <p>Dear Ms. Kumar,</p>

    <p>
    I am writing in response to your application and to outline the next steps in our selection process. Thank you for your application to the Ph.D. program in Computer Science at Riverside University and for expressing interest in joining our research group. We appreciate the clarity with which you described your academic journey and your motivation toward research. Your statement, particularly the one highlighting your focus on distributed system resilience and parallel execution trade-offs, demonstrates strong foundational thinking.
    </p>

    <p>
    After reviewing your CV and preliminary proposal, your prior work on fault-tolerant messaging and micro-failure recovery stood out. Your approach to modelling asynchronous node crashes was detailed, and the included evaluation graphs reflected a good understanding of experimentation maturity. Based on this, I believe your research interest could align well with our ongoing cluster-level scheduler optimization project, as well as current studies related to energy-adaptive computing in partitioned environments.
    </p>

    <p>
    I would therefore like to invite you for a virtual interview where we can discuss research compatibility, supervision planning, and funding pathways in greater detail. The session will include a short 10 to 12 minute presentation of your previous work, followed by a technical discussion and optional problem brainstorming. If you wish, you may also present related artefacts such as datasets, implementation notes, preprints, or prototype reports to support your candidature further.
    </p>

    <p>
    Kindly share your available dates within the next two weeks and specify your preferred time window and communication platform, Zoom, Teams, or Meet. Once confirmed, we will schedule the session and forward the meeting link along with the interview outline. Please feel free to mention any accommodations or preferred discussion format in advance.
    </p>

    <p>
    Upon completion of the interview, shortlisted candidates will be guided to the departmental review stage, after which the final selection committee will issue an admission recommendation. If accepted, you may later request assistance with scholarship processing, research lab workspace allocation, and student housing availability, details of which will be provided to you after the admission round.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you again for your submission. I look forward to interacting with you and understanding your goals more deeply.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

    <p>
    Jairaj R<br>
    Research Fellow<br>
