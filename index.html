    <strong>Re: Application for Ph.D. — Machine Learning & Edge Computing</strong>
</div>

<p>Dear Mr. Nair,</p>

<p>
Thank you for your interest in pursuing a Ph.D. at the Northern Institute of Technology.
Your work on lightweight inference models for IoT devices indicates strong research potential,
particularly for our ongoing projects in edge-optimized machine learning and adaptive learning systems.
</p>

<p>
We would like to schedule a 45-minute virtual discussion to talk about research alignment,
funding possibilities, and expectations for doctoral progression. You may also briefly present
any prior work, publications, or code repositories during our meeting.
</p>

<p>
Please send your availability for the next three weeks and mention your preferred meeting platform.
If not specified, we will proceed with Microsoft Teams.
</p>

<p>
Thank you once again for your application and interest. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
</p>

<br><br>

<p>
Yours sincerely,<br><br>
<strong>Dr. Samuel Whitmore</strong><br>
Senior Lecturer & Ph.D. Supervisor<br>
