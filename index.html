    <h3>Re: Ph.D. Program Enquiry — Machine Learning and Edge Computing</h3>

    <p>
        Dear Mr. Nair,
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you for expressing interest in pursuing a Ph.D. in Machine Learning and
        Edge Computing at the Northern Institute of Technology. I have reviewed your
        statement of purpose and was particularly impressed by your work on
        lightweight inference models for IoT devices. This forms a strong foundation
        for research at our lab.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our research group is currently focused on adaptive distributed learning
        systems, specifically models capable of operating efficiently under
        low-latency and low-power constraints. Your prior work and technical background
        in embedded neural networks suggest that you could be a strong contributor to
        this direction.
    </p>

    <p>
        To proceed further, I would like to schedule a remote discussion with you.
        During the meeting, we will outline potential research themes, funding
        options, and the expected timeline for Ph.D. progression. Typically, this
        conversation lasts around <strong>45 minutes</strong> and includes a brief
        overview of your previous research experience.
    </p>

    <p>
        Kindly share your available dates for the next three weeks (including your
        time zone), and attach any relevant project reports, code repositories, or
        publications. If you have a preferred conferencing platform, feel free to
        mention it; otherwise, I will arrange a Microsoft Teams session and send you
        the joining link.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you once again for considering the Northern Institute of Technology for
        your doctoral studies. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
    </p>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Dr. Samuel Whitmore</strong><br>
        Senior Lecturer & Research Supervisor<br>
